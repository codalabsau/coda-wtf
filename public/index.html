            <p>Hi, internet traveller –</p>
            <p>I'm Tom, engineer/founder at Coda Labs.</p>

            <p>
              Software is a beautiful thing. When done well, apps and websites
              can relieve us of problems we thought we'd have to live with
              forever.
            </p>

            <p>
              But on the flipside, software can somehow make the problem 10x
              worse. We all have that one app at work that makes us want to
              throw our phone out the window!
            </p>

            <p>
              Coda Labs was founded with one mission: to rid the world of ugly
              software. We build software that just works, and looks great.
            </p>

            <p>
              We're your team of software engineers, designers and product
              people whose goal is simple: build you beautiful software.
            </p>

            <p>I hope we can be of service.</p>

            <p>— Tom</p>
